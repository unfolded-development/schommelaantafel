## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build # this now uses generate to make Vercel static deployment happy
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate

# work in the develop branch for auto deployment by anyone with git push rights.
# and merge develop into the main branch to deploy to the production environment.
```
